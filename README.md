A simple code sharing PHP script

This script needs online or local web server like XAMPP to run.

You need to manually edit 3 files in order to make the script working:

- admin/inc/func/functions.php
- public/inc/func/functions.php
- public/p/inc/func/functions.php

and look for the function responsible for handling Google ReCAPTCHA , then type in your own secret key provided by Google.
